Lap is an open-source, local-first photo manager for browsing family albums, finding old photos quickly, and managing large personal media libraries offline.
It is a privacy-focused alternative to cloud photo services: no forced upload, local AI search, folder-first workflow, and free to use.

## Why Lap

- **Local-first by design**: your photos stay on your own disk, with no required cloud account or upload.
- **No library lock-in**: work directly with your existing folders instead of importing everything into a closed database.
- **Private AI tools**: search, similarity, smart tags, and face features run locally on your machine.
- **Built for large collections**: optimized for smooth browsing and organization across libraries with 100k+ files.
- **Open source and free**: no subscription, no forced ecosystem, and code you can inspect.

## Features

- **Flexible library browsing** by date, folder, location, camera, lens, tags, ratings, and faces, with random sorting and a small-image filter.
- **Interactive Map View** to explore geotagged photos and videos in clusters that follow your current filters.
- **Smart Albums** save rule-based views with custom grouping and sorting.
- **Collections and tags** to organize selected files in bulk without moving or duplicating the originals.
- **Local AI search** for text prompts, visual similarity, subjects, face clustering, and optional multilingual search in 50+ languages.
- **Apple Live Photos and Google Motion Photos** with motion playback and a unified Smart Album filter.
- **RAW + JPEG/HEIC pairs** displayed as one item, with linked files kept together during file operations.
- **Configurable RAW thumbnails and previews** using RAW rendering or the camera's embedded preview.
- **Folder-first workflow** with multiple libraries, drag-and-drop import, copy-paste import, filesystem sync, and safe move/copy/delete operations.
- **Date-organized import** with day, month, year, or single-folder layouts, original filenames, and duplicate skipping.
- **Culling and comparison tools** including a four-pane image comparison viewer.
- **Duplicate cleanup** with reclaimable-space summaries and bulk removal across duplicate sets.
- **Customizable viewing** with thumbnails up to 1024 px, adjustable grid sizes and corners, and Quick Preview or separate viewer windows.
- **Desktop integration** with multiple external apps and wallpaper selection on macOS, Windows, and GNOME Linux.
- **Built-in editing** for crop, rotate, flip, resize, and basic image adjustments.
- **Broad format support** for 60+ photo, RAW, and video formats.

## Metadata, Collections, and Moving Files

Lap is folder-first, but not every piece of information shown in Lap is embedded in the original file. This distinction matters when you also manage the same folders in Finder, Explorer, or another photo app.

### What stays with the file

- Your original photos and videos always remain ordinary files in their existing folders.
- When Lap indexes a photo, it reads metadata already stored with that file: embedded EXIF, IPTC, and XMP, plus a sibling XMP sidecar (`photo.xmp` or `photo.jpg.xmp`). Title, headline, description, keywords, creator, copyright, credit, label, file rating, and recorded place are shown in the file info panel and included in text search. Sidecar descriptive values are used ahead of embedded XMP, then IPTC. Capture details and GPS that EXIF already contains are kept; IPTC and XMP fill those fields only when they are empty. Orientation still comes from EXIF.
- A bound `.xmp` sidecar stays with the photo when you rename, move, copy, or delete it in Lap. `.xmp` files are not shown as photos. Apple AAE files remain edit sidecars and are not read as IPTC or XMP. An external sidecar edit is picked up on the next folder scan, even when the image file itself did not change.
- Saving a built-in image edit writes the resulting image to the selected destination.
- When you rename, move, copy, or delete files **in Lap**, Lap updates its local catalog at the same time. It also keeps supported grouped assets, such as Apple Live Photo components, AAE sidecars, bound XMP sidecars, and enabled RAW + JPEG/HEIC pairs, together.

### What is stored locally by Lap

The following are Lap library data. They are stored in Lap's local database or library configuration, not written into EXIF, IPTC, or XMP sidecars, and they are not replaced by keywords, labels, or ratings found in the file. The file rating shown from XMP is separate from the Lap rating you set in the app:

- Collections, Tags, Comments, Favorites, Ratings, and Culling states (including Picks and Rejects)
- Smart Albums and their rules, grouping, sorting, and ordering
- AI search data, face data, thumbnails, and other index/cache data

This data does not travel with a file when it is copied, exported, or moved outside Lap, and it is not available automatically to other applications.

### Working with files outside Lap

Lap can rescan folders and detect many filesystem changes. But changes made outside Lap—such as renaming, moving, replacing, or copying files—can disrupt organization that is stored only in Lap.

For the most reliable results, rename and move files in Lap whenever you rely on Collections, Tags, Comments, Favorites, Ratings, or culling states. If you also manage files outside Lap, back up Lap's database and configuration together with your photos. You can manage the database location and create a backup in **Settings → Storage**.

Deleting Lap's database or configuration removes this local organization and index data, but does not delete your original media files.

## Uninstall Lap

Lap works directly with your existing photo folders. Uninstalling Lap, or deleting its database and cache files, does **not** delete your original photos.

The standard uninstall steps remove the application. To remove Lap completely, quit Lap first, uninstall the application, then delete its local database, thumbnail cache, and configuration files using the cleanup command for your platform.

### macOS

If you installed Lap with Homebrew:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask lap
```

For a manual installation, quit Lap and move `Lap.app` from the `Applications` folder to the Trash.

To remove all Lap database, cache, and configuration files:

```bash
rm -rf "$HOME/Library/Application Support/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/Library/Caches/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/Library/WebKit/com.julyx10.lap"
rm -f "$HOME/Library/Preferences/com.julyx10.lap.plist"
```

### Windows

Open **Settings > Apps > Installed apps**, find **Lap**, and select **Uninstall**.

Then open PowerShell and remove all Lap database, cache, and configuration files:

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\com.julyx10.lap"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue "$env:APPDATA\com.julyx10.lap"
```

### Linux

For DEB installations, uninstall the package:

```bash
sudo apt remove lap
```

For AppImage installations, quit Lap and delete the downloaded `.AppImage` file.

Then remove all Lap database, cache, and configuration files:

```bash
rm -rf "$HOME/.local/share/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/.cache/com.julyx10.lap" \
       "$HOME/.config/com.julyx10.lap"
```

If you selected a custom database storage directory in Lap settings, delete that directory separately after confirming that it contains only Lap database files.
